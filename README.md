## What Our GUI Can Do

Lancaster Music Hall's internal dashboard isn't just a tool — it's the ultimate backstage manager. Designed for the Operations Team and powered by JavaFX + SceneBuilder, our software delivers a smooth, touchscreen-friendly experience tailored for staff use.

Here’s what’s inside:

### Smart Bookings & Scheduling
Easily book rooms and spaces with full control over start/end times, room configuration needs, and performer details. You can view real-time calendar availability, confirm or hold events, and avoid double-bookings with built-in clash detection.

### Financial Control & Contract Generation
Generate and manage client contracts with tracked revenue from ticket sales and venue hire. Our automated invoice calculation takes the stress out of balancing costs, and contracts can be exported as polished PDFs — ready to send.

### Seating Layout Mastery
Plan out restricted-view seating (auto-discounted), accessible zones, and finalize layouts before any tickets are sold. Once finalized, the layout is locked to avoid accidental changes. It’s all visual, intuitive, and efficient.

### Live Venue Usage & Ticket Sales Insights
Track how often each room is used across the year, compare trends with previous months, and visualize ticket sales per show — all in charts. Financial transparency has never been this visual.

### Daily Planner
Staff can print or export the day’s full venue schedule — showing who’s using what, when, and how it’s configured. It’s the ideal daily printout for front desk and setup crew.

### Reviews + Forwarding
Easily manage venue and show reviews with built-in moderation tools. Forward positive feedback to clients with a single click — showing them the audience loved it.

### Inter-Team Collaboration
See internal data shared from Box Office and Marketing like ticketing reports or scheduling requests. The “Team Data Sync” screen acts like your central communications board.

### Built for Staff
User login, alert toggles, backup/restore, and customizable system preferences give the Operations team everything it needs — without the clutter.

And yes, every part of the system is exportable — whether it’s a contract, financial summary, seating map, or daily planner. All PDF generation is handled cleanly with iText 7.

From start to curtain call, this dashboard keeps Lancaster running on time, on budget, and on point.
